CodeIgniter-Paginator
=====================

CodeIgniter-Paginator is a simple pagination creator. I created this library to have more flexibility and to be able to add e.g. a search string to the uri which is preserved while navigating. In the end, this library is an extract from one of my current projects and not an officially supported library. Feel free to use and / or modify this library or send me an email, if you have questions or suggestions (hello@mooseware.org).
